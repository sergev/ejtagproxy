#summary About ejtagproxy project.

= Usage =
{{{
    ejtagproxy [options]
}}}

Options:
{{{
    -d, --daemon        run as daemon
    -p, --port=PORT     use the specified TCP port (default 2000)
    -D, --debug         output debug messages
}}}

To start a debug session:
  # Run ejtagproxy.
  # Attach a USB adapter to target board.
  # Run gdb and connect to the PIC32 target:
{{{
    set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit 6
    set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2
    target remote localhost:2000
}}}

When gdb session is closed, ejtagproxy disconnects from the target board. You can use other tools, like pic32prog, to update the target software and then start a new gdb session.  No need to restart ejtagproxy between sessions.  You can safely run it as a daemon.
